# Contact Survey

In this repository we analyse the results of a community survey run by the Community Based Protect (CBP) team in the Cox's Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh. The survey was designed to be able to help extract information about contact matterns in the settlement and provide a resource to researchers modelling and anlaysing such settlements in the future.

The `Analyse community survey` notebook shows the outputs of the initial anlaysis of the survey.

# Attendence Rates

Further we explore results from a discussion with the CBP team in the Cox's Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh. In which we estimate attendence rates by means of poisson statistics at venues in the camp. 

The `AttendencePlots` notebook shows the findings from this discussion.
